# COVID-19 Regulation Checker
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) led to an unprecendented crisis around the world. Thousands of people around the world got infected and, unfortunately, thousands lost their lives. While the disease, without doubt, has been one of the worst crises faced by humanity, it has ushered in an astonishing period of collaborative effort to tackle the problem. 

While doctors, health care officials, pharmaceutical companies and medical schools have been working tirelessly in the frontlines to treat people and to work on cures/vaccines, a range of computational solutions have been proposed to aid the fight against COVID-19. Such computational solutions include designing contact tracing frameworks, designing more effect testing strategies, etc.
